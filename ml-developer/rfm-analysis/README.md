## Summary
The Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis project aims to categorize users based on their behavior using publicly available transaction data.

## Details
- Use this sample dataset ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/online-retail-dataset ) or select another public dataset or create your own dataset.
- Clean the data, handling any missing values or errors.
- Use basic statistics or simple clustering techniques to categorize customers into groups based on their RFM values.
- Calculate three values for each customer: Recency (how recently they made a purchase), Frequency (how often they buy), and Monetary (how much they spend).
- Create simple visualizations (e.g., bar charts) to display the different customer segments.
- Produce a summary report explaining the RFM analysis, the segments, and how this information could be useful for a business.

## Solution
Design a system that contains all rules in the details and please make a readme file to explain your solution. You could also draw diagrams and flow charts. You could use any software language, platform, tool, library, or framework except those specified as required in the details section. Please push your solution to GitHub and share the related URL with us.
