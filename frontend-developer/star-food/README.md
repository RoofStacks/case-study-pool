## Summary
Imagine that you have a star food restaurant order tracking system. It contains order listing and order registration pages.


## Details
- In the registration form, you must check the name, contact, and at least one meal (meal and quantity are mandatory for the sub-form).
- You can read the list statically, you must add each added record to this list with the newest at the top.
- All pages should support responsive design.
- You could use firebase emulator and firestore to persist and read all data.
- You need to stick to [Figma Designs](https://www.figma.com/file/4Vd4n1zDYJ1mSAMfZnR8hA/Roof-Stacks-Frontend-Case?node-id=2%3A15)
- You could write unit tests and e2e tests
