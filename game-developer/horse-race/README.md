## Summary
Imagine that you have a cross-platform (iOS/Android) game that contains racing horses in 3d with multiplayer support.

## Details 
- Create a mobile app game. It contains 3 main parts. Join, leaderboard and settings.
- Users can join the game as multiplayer. And then the user could select a pre-defined horse with different properties.
- There should be only two users simultaneously in the showing game scene in the multiplayer room.
- When the game begins, horses start running and the winner should be selected randomly via game mechanics (like horse properties). It depends on your game design skills, you are free.
- When the user wins the game, the user could take 1 point as the winner.
- Create a leaderboard to show the top 10 winner users on the main menu.
- Create settings part to on/off game voice.
- We expect the main parts, but the other parts or rules are not strict. You are totally free to design this mini-game.

## Solution
Design a system that contains all rules in the details and please make a readme file to explain your solution. You could also draw diagrams and flow charts. You could use any software language, platform, tool, library, or framework except those specified as required in the details section.
